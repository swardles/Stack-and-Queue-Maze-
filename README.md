# Stack-and-Queue-Maze-
This application finds a way out of the maze specified in the input
 * file (if such a way out exists). The visual feedback is printed to the 
 * screen as a console-based animation. The algorithm used is either 
 * stack-based or queue-based depending on the value of the second argument
 * to the program.
